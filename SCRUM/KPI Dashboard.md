# KPI Dashboard

## Overview

Leadership Southern Maryland (LSM)'s fiscal year starts on July 1 and ends on June 30. The KPI Dashboard discusses how well LSM has been doing relative to the previous fiscal year and relative to the targets as decided by the board and director.

Any sub-goal that has a `Monthly Goal` refers to the calender month. Any sub-goal that has a `Annual Goal` refers to the fiscal year. The degree of success for each sub-goal is based on that sub-goal's numbers for that month compared to the target goal numbers for that month.

Cumulative refers to the cumulative amount since the start of the fiscal year.

## Goal 1

Goal 1 focuses on LSM's Value Proposition and Visibility. Essentially, how well LSM is doing in the community.

### Goal 1.1

Marketing Messages. This is a simple count of all the messages to and references about LSM in the community and on social media.

It is a monthly goal. It is determined by the Communication Committee.

It could be retrieved using API keys on each social media platform along with an allowed editable value section.

### Goal 1.2

This can only be added into the program manually.

### Goal 1.3

EXP 2026 Nominations. This is the cumulative number of nominations that LSM has received for their Executive Program at the end of this KPI month.

It is an annual goal. It is determined by the Recruiting Committee. As an annual goal, the number is cumulative, meaning its degree of success is determined by the cumulative number at the end of the month relative to the target cumulative number at that month.

Nominations come from the Nominations Tracking Sheet in Dropbox. I assume this means manually entered.

## Goal 2

Goal 2 focuses on Community Engagement. How much is LSM doing to engage with the community and how well is it being received.

Most of the data here is entered manually.

All of the sub-goals here are annual, it doesn't make particular sense for them to be monthly goals in the first place.

## Goal 3

Goal 3 focuses on Revenue. Most of these are `cumulative monthly` and yet that number doesn't particularly reflect the whole story. Oftentimes, the monthly number is an arbitrary value, and the important value is the annual goal.

### Goal 3.1

Fundraising Event Rev. The cumulative monthly dollar amount of money raised from fundraising events (like the golf tournament).

It is an annual goal. It is determined by the Development Committee.

I don't know from whence the data comes.

This information is just a summation of the lunch sponsors, program sponsors, and event sponsors. It could be inputted manually, but if the information from each other grouping is properly evaluated, it could be done automatically.

## Key

**BLUE:** The current (monthly) value exceeds the target (monthly) value by >120%.

**GREEN:** The current (monthly) value is within 80%-120% of the target (monthly) value.

**YELLOW:** The current (monthly) value is within 60%-80% of the target (monthly) value.

**RED:** The current (monthly) value is below the target (monthly) value by <60%.

### Goal Performance Summary

Each sub-goal adds up its weight (by some algorithm) to determine how well each goal meets the target. This algorithm should make sense.
